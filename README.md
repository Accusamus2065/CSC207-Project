# CSC207-Project

## Description
<!-- Problem Domain -->
The problem domain that the project focuses on is healthcare, specifically the establishment of the doctor–patient
relationship, when the patient is trying to find the best doctor to treat their specific ailments, and the
simplification of the initial screening phase as to enable ease of access to formal diagnosis and treatment.

<!-- Description -->
The primary function of this project is to initiate and facilitate the doctor–patient relationship by providing
preliminary diagnosis for a patient via an API call to Dialogflow, a natural language processing model, in order to
identify symptoms and possible diseases, and then connecting them to a doctor who specialises in the areas that the
diseases are concerned with.

The application will have 3 primary stages:
1. Preliminary identification of the patient's symptoms and possible causes through Dialogflow.
2. Referral to a list of general practitioners or specialists in the affected fields, from which the patient can then choose to receive treatment from.
3. A chatting feature, including text, picture, and video, between the doctor and patient to provide treatment.

Users and practitioners will be able to log in and log out of accounts, and basic user information will be stored via MongoDB.
